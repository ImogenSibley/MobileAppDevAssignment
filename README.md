Styling Follows React Style Guide (2021) https://dev.to/abrahamlawson/react-style-guide-24pp
Reference naming uses PascalCase for React components and camelCase for their instances. camelCase is used for prop names and PascalCase is used if 
the prop value is a React Component. Component naming uses filename as component name. Higher-order component naming uses a composite of the 
higher-order component's name and the passed in component's name as the displayName on the generated component. Declaration names the component by 
reference and doesn't use displayName for naming components. JSX tags are wrapped in parentheses when they span more than one line. 

Functional components were used as they do not require a render method and are stateless. Hooks can also be easily used in functional components via
useState and constructors are not used.
